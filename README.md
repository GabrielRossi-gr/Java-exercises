#  The purpose of this repository is to report my evolution in the Java language.
 
  I had contact with Java for the first time in college, I put each exercise inside a folder named with the date to be able to observe my evolution with precision, not all folders are projects, many of them contain code drafts and may have semantics and errors of syntax.
